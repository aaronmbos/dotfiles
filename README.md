# DOTFILES

> In Unix-like operating systems, any file or folder that starts with a dot character (for example, /home/user/.config), commonly called a dot file or dotfile, is to be treated as hidden â€“ that is, the ls command does not display them unless the `-a` or `-A` flags (ls -a or ls -A) are used.
